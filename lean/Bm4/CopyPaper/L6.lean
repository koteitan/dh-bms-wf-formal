  Lemma 6.8 of the paper (local proof V): the sixth claim of Theorem 6.3 for row `k`,
  assuming `(C1)_k`, `(C5)_k` and, according to the row, `(C3)_k` (for `k < m₀`) or `(C4)`
  (for `k ≥ m₀`).

  The argument is the paper's own (§6.7).

  1. *Passing property* (6.16).  If a column of an earlier copy `B_a` (`a < c'`) is a
     `k`-ancestor of `D_j⁽ᶜ'⁾`, the chain from `D_j⁽ᶜ'⁾` must pass through the leading column
     `P⁽ᶜ'⁾`.  Indeed, follow the `k`-parent chain down from `D_j⁽ᶜ'⁾`.  As long as the index
     `j` is non-zero, `(C5)_k` says the direct `k`-parent is either in `G` or again in `B_{c'}`;
     the first alternative is impossible, because the chain has to reach a column of `B_a`,
     which lies at or right of `p`.  So the chain stays inside `B_{c'}` and its index strictly
     decreases at every step, hence it meets index `0`.

  2. *High rows* `k ≥ m₀`.  Both sides of `(C6)_k` are false: an ancestor from an earlier copy
     would, by the passing property, be a `k`-ancestor of a leading column of a copy `q ≥ 1`,
     and `(C4)` forces every such ancestor into `G`.

  3. *Low rows* `k < m₀`.  `(C3)_k` applied to the leading column (index `0`, which is a
     `k`-ancestor of `C` in `A` because `p` is the `m₀`-parent of `C`) gives the bridge
     `P⁽ᶜ'⁾ ≺ₖ P⁽ᶜ'⁺¹⁾`.  Forward: `D_i⁽ᵃ⁾ ≺ₖ P⁽ᶜ'⁾ ≺ₖ P⁽ᶜ'⁺¹⁾ ≼ₖ D_j⁽ᶜ'⁺¹⁾`, the last step
     being the copy-internal tail transported by `(C1)_k`.  Backward: `D_i⁽ᵃ⁾` and `P⁽ᶜ'⁾` are
     two `k`-ancestors of `P⁽ᶜ'⁺¹⁾` with `D_i⁽ᵃ⁾ < P⁽ᶜ'⁾`, so Lemma 2.2 (4) makes the first an
     ancestor of the second; then transport the tail back with `(C1)_k`.

  This file uses only the setup of `Bm4/Copy.lean` (structure, positions, entries, ascension)
  together with Lemma 2.2; it uses none of the closed forms.

/-! ### The passing property (6.16)

Following the `k`-parent chain down from `D_j⁽ᶜ'⁾`: by `(C5)_k` each step either leaves for `G`
— impossible, since the chain must reach `D_i⁽ᵃ⁾ ≥ p` — or stays in `B_{c'}` with a strictly
smaller index, so index `0` is reached. -/
