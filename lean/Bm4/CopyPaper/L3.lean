  Lemma 6.5 of the paper (local proof II): the third claim of Theorem 6.3 for a row `k < m₀`,
  assuming only `(C1)_k` and, when `k = k'+1`, the claim `(C3)_{k'}` of the previous row.

  The argument is the paper's own (§6.4).  Fix `q ≥ 1` and compare the two intervals

      I_q = B_{q-1} ⌢ (P⁽�q⁾)      and      I_0 = B₀ ⌢ (C),

  i.e. in position language the positions `≥ pos (q-1) 0` with target `pos q 0`, and the
  positions `≥ p` with target `c = A.len - 1`.

  1. Candidates correspond: for `i < s`, `pos (q-1) i` is a structural `k`-candidate of
     `pos q 0` iff `p + i` is one of `c`.  For `k = 0` both sides hold outright; for
     `k = k'+1` both sides are `≺_{k'}`, which is `(C3)_{k'}`.
  2. Validity corresponds: a structural `k`-candidate `D_i` of `C` ascends in row `k`
     (Lemma 4.1, via `asc_of_cand_c`), so its entry in `B_{q-1}` is `D_i(k) + (q-1)Δ_k`,
     while `P⁽�q⁾(k) = P(k) + qΔ_k = C(k) + (q-1)Δ_k`.  The two `<` comparisons agree.
  3. Direct parents therefore correspond (both are "the largest valid candidate in the
     interval", and the positions strictly inside the two intervals correspond by
     `between_prev_copy`), and ancestors follow by taking the last step of the chain and
     transporting the remaining, copy-internal part with `(C1)_k`.

  This file uses only the setup of `Bm4/Copy.lean` (structure, positions, entries, ascension)
  together with Lemma 2.2 and Lemma 4.1; it uses none of the closed forms.

/-! ### Entries in the two intervals

Both intervals differ by the same shift `(q-1) * Δ k`, on the columns that matter. -/

entry in the bad part shifted by `q * Δ k`. -/

/-- The bridge for direct parents: `D_i⁽�q⁻¹⁾` is the `k`-parent of `P⁽�q⁾` iff `D_i` is the
`k`-parent of `C`.  Both say "the largest valid structural candidate in the interval", and
the interiors of the two intervals correspond index-wise. -/

/-- The bridge for ancestors.  Take the last step of the chain: it is a direct parent of the
target inside the interval, handled by `parent_bridge`; what remains lies inside one copy
(resp. inside the bad part) and is transported by `(C1)_k`. -/
