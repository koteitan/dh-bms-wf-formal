  Lemmas 6.9 and 6.10 of the paper (local proof of the boundary claim `(C4)`).

  `(C4)` says: for `q ≥ 1` and every row `k ≥ m₀`, every `k`-ancestor of the leading column
  `P⁽ᑫ⁾ = pos q 0` of copy `Bq` lies in `G`, i.e. is `< p`.

  The paper's argument (§6.8) is the same in both lemmas, and only the way the entry
  inequality for earlier copies is obtained differs.

  * Since `k ≥ m₀`, `anc_mono` reduces everything to the row `k = m₀`.
  * Row `m₀` is not an ascending row (`not_asc_of_ge`), so copying leaves it untouched
    (`col_pos_not_asc`): the `m₀`-entry of `D_i⁽ᵃ⁾` is `D_i(m₀)` for every copy `a`, and the
    `m₀`-entry of `P⁽ᑫ⁾` is `P(m₀)`.
  * Hence a position `y` of the interval `[p, P⁽ᑫ⁾)` is a *valid* `m₀`-candidate of `P⁽ᑫ⁾`
    only if `D_i(m₀) < P(m₀)` for the index `i` with `y = D_i⁽ᵃ⁾`.  For `i = 0` this is
    `P(m₀) < P(m₀)`, and for `i > 0` the maximality of `P` (`parent_max` applied to
    `b.hpar`, packaged as `val_c_le_of_cand_m`) gives `C(m₀) ≤ D_i(m₀)`, whereas
    `P(m₀) < C(m₀)`; so no such `y` exists.
  * With no internal valid candidate, Lemma 6.2 (2) (`parent_lt_of_no_intECand`) puts the
    direct `m₀`-parent of `P⁽ᑫ⁾` in `G`, and an ancestor is `≤` the last member of its chain,
    so it lies in `G` too.

  The step "`D_i` is a structural `m₀`-candidate of `C`" is free when `m₀ = 0`
  (every earlier column is a structural `0`-candidate) — this is Lemma 6.9.  When `m₀ > 0` it
  has to be imported from the copy: the hypothesis is `D_i⁽ᵃ⁾ ≺_{m₀-1} P⁽ᑫ⁾`, which `(C6)_{m₀-1}`
  moves down to `D_i⁽ᵃ⁾ ≺_{m₀-1} P⁽ᵃ⁺¹⁾` and `(C3)_{m₀-1}` transports to
  `D_i ≺ᴬ_{m₀-1} C`, i.e. `cand A m₀ (p+i) c` — this is Lemma 6.10.

  This file uses only the setup of `Bm4/Copy.lean` (structure, positions, entries, ascension)
  together with Lemma 2.2 and the interval lemmas of `Bm4/CopyPaper/Interval.lean`; it uses
  none of the closed forms.

`k`-ancestor of `P⁽ᑫ⁾` lies in `G`.  The direct parent is `< p` by Lemma 6.2 (2), and an
ancestor is at most the last member of its chain. -/

/-! ### Lemma 6.9: the case `m₀ = 0` -/

/-- **Lemma 6.9**: for `m₀ = 0`, `(C4)` holds with no other claim.

Every column `D_i` with `i > 0` is a structural `0`-candidate of `C` (structural
`0`-candidacy is just "to the left"), so the maximality of `P` gives
`C(0) ≤ D_i(0)`, while `P(0) < C(0)`.  Row `0 = m₀` is unchanged by copying, so no earlier
copy — and, `P⁽ᑫ⁾` being the head of its own copy, no column of the copy itself — contains a
valid `0`-candidate of `P⁽ᑫ⁾`; hence the whole `0`-ancestor set of `P⁽ᑫ⁾` lies in `G`. -/

/-- **Lemma 6.10**: for `m₀ > 0`, `(C4)` follows from `(C3)_{m₀-1}` and `(C6)_{m₀-1}`.

A structural `m₀`-candidate of `P⁽ᑫ⁾` inside an earlier copy `Ba` (`a < q`) is a
`(m₀-1)`-ancestor `D_i⁽ᵃ⁾ ≺_{m₀-1} P⁽ᑫ⁾`.  `(C6)_{m₀-1}` walks the target down to `P⁽ᵃ⁺¹⁾`
and `(C3)_{m₀-1}` transports the result to `D_i ≺ᴬ_{m₀-1} C`, i.e. `D_i` is a structural
`m₀`-candidate of `C`.  From there the argument of Lemma 6.9 applies verbatim. -/
