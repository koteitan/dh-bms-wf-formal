  Existence of parents in the expanded array, derived from the paper's own six claims
  (Theorem 6.3, assembled in `Bm4/CopyPaper/Assemble.lean`).

  Proposition 7.1 needs only one consequence of the copy lemma: a column of `G ⌢ B₀ ⌢ B₁ ⌢ ⋯`
  whose entry is positive has a `k`-parent.  The two lemmas below supply it in the two shapes
  the induction of §7 produces:

  * `hasParent_tA_of_hasParent_A` — column `j` of any copy, from a `k`-parent of `D_j` in `A`,
    by (C1) when that parent lies in the bad part and by (C2) when it lies in `G`;
  * `hasParent_tA_lead` — the leading column `P⁽ᑫ⁾` of a copy `q ≥ 1` in a row `k < m₀`, by (C3)
    from the `k`-parent of `C` inside `B₀`.

  Nothing here characterises the ancestor relation of the expanded array: the paper's statement
  of the copy lemma is the six claims themselves, and the induction of §7 uses only these two
  existence facts.

/-- (C1) and (C2): if `D_j` has a `k`-parent in `A`, then column `j` of every copy has a
`k`-parent in the expanded array.

A parent `y` of `D_j` in `A` is either in the bad part — then (C1) turns `y ≺ᴬₖ D_j` into
`y⁽ᑫ⁾ ≺ₖ D_j⁽ᑫ⁾` — or in `G`, where (C2) does the same.  Either way `D_j⁽ᑫ⁾` has a `k`-ancestor,
and the last step of that chain is a `k`-parent. -/
